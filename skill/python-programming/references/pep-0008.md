# PEP 8 Defaults (Use When Repo Is Silent)

Use repo tooling/config and local conventions first. When you need a neutral default, use PEP 8.

All citations should use stable section anchors (not line numbers).

## Layout

- Indentation: 4 spaces; continuation lines aligned or hanging indent.
  - Ref: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#indentation
- Maximum line length: prefer repo config; otherwise follow PEP 8 guidance.
  - Ref: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length
- Blank lines: use to separate top-level defs and logical sections.
  - Ref: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#blank-lines

## Imports

- Put imports at the top of the file.
  - Ref: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports
- Group imports: standard library, third-party, local application; separate with blank lines.
  - Ref: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports
- Prefer absolute imports unless the package structure clearly prefers relative imports.
  - Ref: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports

## Whitespace

- Avoid extra whitespace in parentheses/brackets/braces.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.
- Surround top-level function/class definitions with blank lines.
  - Ref: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements

## Naming

- Functions/variables: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Ref: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions

## Comments

- Prefer clear code over comments.
- Keep comments up to date and accurate.
  - Ref: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#comments

## Programming Recommendations (Selected)

- Compare to `None` with `is` / `is not`.
- Prefer `isinstance(x, T)` over `type(x) is T`.
  - Ref: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations
