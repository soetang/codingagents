# PEP 257 Notes (Docstrings)

This skill uses Google-style docstrings, but PEP 257 is still useful for baseline docstring conventions.

Use section anchors for citations.

- General docstring conventions (what docstrings are, where they go).
  - Ref: https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/

Selected compatibility notes:

- Use triple double quotes for docstrings.
- Keep a one-line summary for simple cases.
- Put a blank line after the summary when adding more detail.
